                <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>

                <p>The Great Gatsby, follows Jay Gatsby, <strong>a man who orders his life around one desire</strong>: to be reunited
                    with
                    Daisy Buchanan, the love he lost five years earlier. Gatsby's quest leads him from poverty to
                    wealth,
                    into the arms of his beloved, and eventually to death.</p>

                <h1> To Kill a Mocking Bird</h1>

                <p>In this story of innocents destroyed by evil, <strong>the 'mockingbird' comes to represent the idea of
                    innocence.</strong>
                    Thus, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence." ... 'Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make
                    music for us to enjoyâ€¦but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.
